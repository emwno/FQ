>_The ridding of your trouble-est of the most troublesome everyday troubles is almost upon you!_

This app was built to rid the common man/woman/apache-helicopter/fluid-gender of the everyday trouble of _(politely)_ asking a special someone (or thing if you're into that) to **fuck**:
- off
- you
- it
- that chair
- the letter V
- IU (Indiana University)
- (many fucking more)

Development-wise, this is a small-ish summer project for me to refresh on some Android concepts/practices and familiarize myself with new api's, development techniques/practices, retrofit and interacting with the camera. Basically a continued exploration of the Android ecosystem (fun!). The app is built around gestures (because I thought it would be cool), from adjusting different properties to revealing layouts. Moreover, it will be published to the playstore when it's ready.

#### How it works
This uses [foaas](https://www.foaas.com) as a backend to fetch the templates and generate a unique fuck quote (FQ) based on the users input.

#### How to use it
1. Choose a Fuck
2. Fill-in the blank(s)
3. Take a picture
4. Cry and and eat a [Tarte au citron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_tart)
5. Share your idiosyncratic Fuck!
